# metabolomicsRegression

This tutorial will use the data from de Abreu e Lima et al. (2017) to predict hybrid biomass in the field using the metabolic profiles of primary roots from the hybrid seedlings.

It will cover pre-processing, cross-validation and importance analysis using OLS, PLS, LASSO, ridge, elastic net, SVM and random forests.
