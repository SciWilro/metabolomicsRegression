# Regression tutorial for metabolomics data

This tutorial will use the data from de Abreu e Lima et al. (2017) to predict hybrid biomass (FW) in the field using the metabolic profiles of primary roots from the hybrid seedlings (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/tpj.13495/full).

It will cover pre-processing, cross-validation and importance analysis using OLS, PLS, LASSO, ridge, elastic net, SVM and random forests.

No. hybrids - 362
No. metabolites - 165

Note that the biomass data set also includes dry weight (DW) which I do not use, but you can try yourself.
